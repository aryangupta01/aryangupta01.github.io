description = """
This project leverages `CrewAI` framework with specialized AI agents to generate complete storybooks. Built with `FastAPI`, it orchestrates `OpenAI GPT-4` for narrative generation and `DALL-E 3` for chapter illustrations. The system features `asynchronous processing`, `multi-agent collaboration`, and automatic `markdown-to-PDF conversion`. Each story includes structured 5-chapter narratives with custom illustrations, delivered through a `RESTful API` interface.
