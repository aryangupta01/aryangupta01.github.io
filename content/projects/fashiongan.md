title = "FashionGAN - Deep Learning Fashion Generator"
description = """
A `Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)` implementation for generating synthetic fashion images using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Built with `TensorFlow/Keras`, featuring custom `Generator` and `Discriminator` architectures with `Conv2D`, `UpSampling2D`, and `LeakyReLU` layers. Implements adversarial training with `Adam optimizers`, `Binary Cross-Entropy loss`, and noise injection for improved convergence. The model uses `subclassed training loops` with gradient tape for backpropagation optimization.
