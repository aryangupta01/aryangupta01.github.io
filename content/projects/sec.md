description = "Developed an AI agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to autonomously play Super Mario Bros. Implemented CNN-based policy networks with frame stacking and grayscale preprocessing for visual state representation. Utilized Stable Baselines3 framework with PyTorch backend, achieving intelligent gameplay through deep reinforcement learning with experience replay and policy gradient optimization."
