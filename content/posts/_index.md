Whether it's fine-tuning a BERT model, designing smart APIs with FastAPI and LangChain, or exploring the math behind causality in time series, I love bringing intelligence to life through code.

*When I'm not coding or reading research papers*, you'll probably find me vibing to music, watching sci-fi movies (I'm that **Interstellar + Blade Runner** kind of person), or battling it out on the basketball or badminton court."""}
